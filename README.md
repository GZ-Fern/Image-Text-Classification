# Image & Text Classification
Deep learning models for image classification with CNN and text classification with LSTM using TensorFlow

----
This project combines computer vision and natural language processing into:
- CNN for image classification on the CIFAR-100 dataset with a test accuracy of ~37.5%
- LSTM for text classification on the Reuters dataset with a test accuracy ~63%

Both models include data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and training visualizations with the use of TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib.
